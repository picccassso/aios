# CURRENT TASK: Phase 1 - Boot to Hello World

## Overview
**Duration**: 7 days  
**Goal**: Get a bootable ARM64 system with serial I/O working in QEMU
**Started**: Day 1

## Phase 1 Detailed Progress

### Day 1: Development Environment Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Tools already installed (skipped - user confirmed)
- [x] Create project structure (boot/, build/ directories created)
- [x] Create build system (Makefile, run.sh created and tested)
- [x] Test build environment (QEMU confirmed working)

**Note**: Cross-compiler path may need adjustment - aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc not found in PATH

### Day 2-3: Minimal Boot Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Study ARM64 boot requirements (64-byte header, exception levels, initialization)
- [x] Create boot.S with header and CPU init (ARM64 header, EL1 setup, MMU/cache disable)
- [x] Stack setup (16-byte aligned, 64KB space)
- [x] Create linker script (boot.ld at 0x40000000, proper sections)
- [x] C entry point with BSS clearing (main.c with infinite loop)
- [x] Build and test (boots successfully in QEMU without crashing)

**Status**: ✅ Boots cleanly, cross-compiler working (aarch64-elf-gcc), ready for serial I/O

### Day 4-5: Serial Output Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Study PL011 UART registers (0x09000000, control/data/flag registers)
- [x] UART initialization sequence (disable, baud rate, 8N1, enable TX)
- [x] Implement putchar() (FIFO polling, newline handling)
- [x] Implement puts() and basic printf() (%s, %x support)
- [x] Test messages ("Hello ARM64 OS!" displaying correctly)

**Status**: ✅ Serial output working perfectly! All functions tested and operational.

### Day 6-7: Basic Input and Polish ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] UART input configuration (RX enabled, FIFO configured)
- [x] Implement getchar() and gets() (polling, buffer management, size limits)
- [x] Echo functionality with backspace (visual feedback, screen update)
- [x] Code cleanup and documentation (organized structure, comments)
- [x] Final testing of all I/O (interactive input/output working)

**Status**: ✅ All input/output functional! Interactive shell ready.

## Success Criteria - PHASE 1 COMPLETE! ✅
- [x] Boots successfully in QEMU every time
- [x] Shows "Hello ARM64 OS!" on screen
- [x] Can type characters and see them echoed
- [x] Can input entire lines of text
- [x] No crashes or hangs

## Final Status - PHASE 1 ✅ COMPLETE
**All deliverables achieved!** ARM64 OS Phase 1 successfully implemented:

### Technical Achievements:
- ✅ ARM64 boot with proper header and CPU initialization
- ✅ PL011 UART driver with full I/O support
- ✅ Interactive shell foundation ready
- ✅ 2.3KB kernel image, 67KB total with stack

### Build System:
- ✅ Cross-compilation working (aarch64-elf-gcc)
- ✅ Debug builds, size reporting, listing generation
- ✅ Clean code organization with proper headers

**READY FOR PHASE 2: Memory allocation and basic shell implementation**
