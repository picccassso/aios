- [x] Implement string functions: strcmp, strlen, strcpy, strncmp, strncpy
- [x] Create command table framework (command_table with help, echo, clear, meminfo)
- [x] Design input tokenization approach (shell_tokenize function with argc/argv style)
- [x] Test all Day 10 implementations - ALL WORKING CORRECTLY

**Status**: ✅ Day 10 complete - Command structure and string functions fully implemented and tested
**Files created**: include/string.h, src/string.c, include/shell.h, src/shell.c
