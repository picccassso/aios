### CRITICAL BUG FIX ✅ COMPLETED  
**Issue**: `help` command caused infinite loop and system freeze
**Root Cause**: Unbounded loops in `cmd_help` and `shell_find_command` functions relied solely on NULL termination without bounds checking
**Fix Applied**: Added bounds checking (`i < 17`) to both functions to prevent infinite loops
**Files Modified**: src/shell.c (lines ~671 and ~1533)
**Result**: System now stable, `help` command functional

### CRITICAL BUG FIX ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
**Issue**: Commands found but produce no output (about, help, etc. execute but no output appears)
**Root Cause**: Performance monitoring code in `shell_execute_command()` hanging after command execution
**Symptoms**: 
- Commands don't show "Unknown command" (they're being found)
- No output appears from any command
- System remains responsive, prompt works
**Fix Applied**: Temporarily disabled performance monitoring in `shell_execute_command()` (lines 706-707, 713)
**Files Modified**: src/shell.c (commented out performance monitoring calls)
**Result**: ✅ FIXED - User confirmed all commands now work correctly with performance monitoring disabled
