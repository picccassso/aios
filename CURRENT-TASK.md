# CURRENT TASK: Phase 3 - Essential Commands and Polish

## Overview
**Duration**: 7 days (Day 15-21)
**Goal**: Add essential commands and polish the shell experience  
**Started**: Day 15
**Current Phase**: Day 15 - Memory Inspection Commands

## Rules Being Followed
✅ Implement only Phase 3 outline features
✅ Get human approval before each major step  
✅ Maintain CURRENT-TASK.md continuously
✅ Reference context/simplified-phase3-commands.md when confused
✅ Test after each day completion
✅ Build only on Phase 1-2 infrastructure  
✅ Preserve all existing functionality (7 current commands)

## Phase 3 Detailed Progress

### Day 15: Memory Inspection - Peek Command ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
**Objective**: Implement peek command for memory address inspection

#### Task 1: Address Parsing & Validation ⚠️ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Parse memory address from argument (hex/decimal support)
- [ ] Support hexadecimal input with 0x prefix
- [ ] Validate address is accessible and safe
- [ ] Handle decimal addresses too
- [ ] Validate address range and alignment
- [ ] Provide clear error messages

#### Task 2: Value Display & Safety PENDING (await approval)
- [ ] Read value at memory address
- [ ] Display value as hexadecimal
- [ ] Display as decimal  
- [ ] Show ASCII if printable
- [ ] Format output cleanly
- [ ] Prevent reading dangerous areas (kernel code, hardware registers)
- [ ] Add safety warnings

#### Day 15 Testing PENDING
- [ ] Test peek with various valid addresses
- [ ] Test with invalid addresses (error handling)
- [ ] Test hex and decimal address formats
- [ ] Verify safety checks work
- [ ] Confirm no system crashes

**Status**: ⚠️ IN PROGRESS - Starting Task 1 (Address Parsing)

### Day 16: Memory Inspection - Poke & Dump PENDING (await Day 15 completion)
**Objective**: Complete memory inspection suite

#### Tasks Planned:
- Implement poke command for memory writing
- Implement dump command for hex memory display  
- Enhance meminfo with detailed statistics
- Test all memory commands together

### Day 17-21: PENDING (sequential progression with human approval)

## Current Implementation Status
**Existing Commands (7)**: help, echo, clear, meminfo, about, uptime, calc
**Target Commands**: 10+ total (adding 3+ new commands)

**Files to Modify**:
- src/shell.c (add new command implementations)
- include/shell.h (declare new command functions) 
- Update command_table in shell_init()

## Success Criteria - Day 15
- [ ] Peek command added to command table
- [ ] Address parsing works (hex and decimal)
- [ ] Memory reading functional and safe
- [ ] Value display in multiple formats
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] No crashes or system instability
- [ ] All existing 7 commands still work

## Next Steps
1. Complete Day 15 Task 1 (Address Parsing)
2. Request human approval for Day 15 Task 2
3. Complete Day 15 Task 2 (Value Display & Safety)  
4. Test Day 15 thoroughly
5. Request human approval for Day 16
