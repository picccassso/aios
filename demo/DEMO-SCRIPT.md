2. **Alternative**: Have pre-built kernel.img ready
3. **Backup Plan**: Show documentation and explain architecture

### If Commands Hang
1. **Exit QEMU**: `Ctrl+A, X`
2. **Restart Demo**: `./run.sh` 
3. **Continue**: Most commands are very reliable

### If Build Fails
1. **Check Dependencies**: Verify toolchain installation
2. **Use Backup**: Pre-built kernel.img
3. **Focus on Features**: Show existing system running

### If Terminal Issues
1. **Colors Not Working**: Use `color off` command
2. **Arrow Keys Not Working**: Demonstrate with direct typing
3. **Terminal Too Small**: Use `clear` command frequently

## Post-Demo Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers

**"How much code is this?"**
> "Approximately 2,500 lines of C and ARM64 assembly. The shell system alone is about 1,500 lines with 17 fully-featured commands."

**"Does it support multitasking?"**
> "No, this is a single-process educational OS. The focus is on fundamental concepts like boot process, memory management, and hardware interaction."

**"Can you add new commands?"**
> "Absolutely! The architecture is designed for extensibility. Adding a new command requires implementing the handler function and adding it to the command table."

**"What about virtual memory?"**
> "Intentionally omitted for educational simplicity. The system runs at physical addresses with MMU disabled, making memory management concepts clearer."

**"Is the source code available?"**
> "This is an educational project. All source code, documentation, and build instructions are included."
